# doug-script
It's a scripting language that will primarily be used by it's author, doug. I'm terrible at naming projects, so I often just end up using my own name, ok? The only thing these vanity projects have in common is that they're usually not very good, not very well thought out, and will probably never be finished. Proceed with caution.

# Design
I want something like Python, but that's easier to hack and add features to, without diving into the legacy CPython code base, or stepping on language purists' toes. I want to try to make a scripting language that has the compile-time checking verbosity of Rust, but the portability and embeddability of Lua.
