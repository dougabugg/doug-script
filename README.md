# doug-script
It's a scripting language that will primarily be used by it's author, doug. I'm terrible at naming projects, so I often just end up using my own name, ok? The only thing the various personal projects that my name have in common is that they're usually not very good, and might never be finished. It's not supposed to be "good branding" or whatever.
